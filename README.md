# Age Estimation based on Neural Networks using Face Features (2010 Implementation)

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of an age estimation system based on neural networks using face features, originally developed in 2010. The implementation follows the methodology described in the article "Age Estimation based on Neural Networks using Face Features" by Nabil Hewahi, Lahouari Ghouti, and Ayoub Al-Hamadi.

## Overview
The implemented system utilizes neural networks to estimate the age of individuals based on facial features. It processes images and extracts relevant features for age estimation. The neural network model is trained on the FG-NET dataset.

## Dependencies
This project requires MATLAB to run. Additionally, the following MATLAB toolboxes are needed:
- Image Processing Toolbox
- Neural Network Toolbox

## Dataset
The FG-NET dataset, originally used in this project, is not provided with this repository. Unfortunately, it is no longer available due to certain restrictions or changes in accessibility. However, alternative datasets for age estimation research can be used for testing and evaluation purposes.

## Example Images
The `images` folder contains a set of sample images for testing or example purposes. These images consist of 31 images of 2 individuals, which can be used to demonstrate the functionality of the age estimation system.

## Usage
To use this system:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have MATLAB installed with the required toolboxes.
3. Run the MATLAB scripts to execute the age estimation system.
4. If you have an alternative dataset, replace the FG-NET dataset paths with your dataset paths in the code.

### Running the GUI
If you prefer to use the GUI for running the age estimation system, follow these steps:
1. Open MATLAB.
2. Navigate to the directory where you cloned this repository.
3. Run the main GUI script (e.g., `GUI.m`) by typing its name in the MATLAB command window and pressing Enter.
4. The GUI interface should now be visible. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the age estimation system.
